    <div class="card-content">
      <p>
        In consideration for the Services and subject to the Operational Manager‚Äôs compliance with his obligations hereunder, the Operational Manager shall be entitled to a Fixed Monthly Retainer as detailed below.
      </p>

      <h3>3.1. Scope of Work (Monthly Basis)</h3>
       <ul>
           <li> This agreement covers ongoing operational management services provided on a monthly basis, anticipated to cover approximately <span class="highlight">4 to 6 games</span> per month.</li>
           <li> The estimated monthly workload involves approximately <span class="highlight daysWork">8 to 12 Work Days</span> (defined as Setup and Event/Game Days) and <span class="highlight daysTravel">10 to 12 Travel/Preparation Days</span> (defined as days primarily involving travel, separate preparation not involving on-site setup, or non-working days between events required for logistics), totaling approximately 18 to 24 active days per month.</li>
           <li> The Fixed Monthly Retainer detailed below is based on an average expectation of 5 games, 10 Work Days, and 11 Travel/Preparation Days per month. The Retainer remains fixed regardless of minor monthly variations within the 4-6 game range, assuming the overall workload remains reasonably consistent. Significant deviations may require discussion and mutual agreement on adjustments.</li>
       </ul>

      <h3>3.2. Fixed Monthly Retainer Calculation</h3>
      <p>The Total Fixed Monthly Retainer is <span class="highlight">$8,649.06 USD</span>. This amount comprises a Compensation Component based on effective daily rates and an Expense Component, calculated as follows based on the average monthly scope:</p>
       <table>
           <thead>
               <tr>
                   <th>Component</th>

               </tr>

                   <td>~10 days</td>

               </tr>
           </tbody>
       </table>
        <p class="calculationNote">The effective daily compensation rates ($356.86 / $256.86) meet the minimum requirement of $300/$200 per day respectively and are calculated to achieve the agreed Total Fixed Monthly Retainer (approximately equivalent to 30,000 ILS before applicable VAT), inclusive of the Expense Component.</p>

         </ul>

      <h3>3.5. Advance Payment</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>The Company shall provide a monthly Advance Payment of <span class="highlight">$2,500 USD</span> (based on an average of 5 games per month at $500 USD per game - *Note: Advance calculation rate differs from daily compensation rates*).</li>
            <li>This advance is intended to assist with initial monthly expenses borne by the Operational Manager on Travel/Preparation Days and will be paid at the beginning of each calendar month covered by this agreement.</li>
           <li>This advance amount will be deducted from the corresponding Fixed Monthly Retainer payment due for that month.</li>

       <ul>
           <li>The Fixed Monthly Retainer (<span class="highlight">$8,649.06 USD</span>), less the monthly Advance Payment ($2,500 USD), resulting in a remaining monthly balance of <span class="highlight">$6,149.06 USD</span>, shall be paid monthly in arrears.</li>
